## Project Overview

1. **Project Overview**:  
   This project implements a secure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system, enhancing account security by requiring two forms of identification for login.

2. **Tech Stack**:  
   Built with Node.js, Express, Speakeasy, Passport.js, React, and React Context API, leveraging both server-side and client-side authentication techniques.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:  
   MFA is a layered security approach that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to gain access, strengthening security beyond standard password-based systems.

4. **Backend Setup**:  
   Node.js and Express handle the backend, with Speakeasy generating time-based one-time passcodes (TOTPs) for the 2FA, and Passport.js managing user authentication.

5. **Frontend Integration**:  
   The frontend, built with React, includes a user-friendly 2FA login interface, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience.

6. **Session Management**:  
   Utilizes React Context API to manage user sessions, enhancing session tracking and state management for authenticated sessions.

7. **API Integration**:  
   Integrates APIs for real-time authentication, enabling seamless verification and validation of the 2FA codes generated and entered by users.

8. **User Account Security**:  
   With 2FA enabled, user accounts are secured against unauthorized access, improving the overall integrity of user data and reducing security risks.

9. **Learning Outcomes**:  
   This project provides hands-on experience in implementing 2FA, managing sessions with React Context, and integrating API-based real-time authentication for a robust security solution.

10. **Future Enhancements**:  
   Potential enhancements include integrating additional MFA factors, improving UI/UX for 2FA input, and optimizing session persistence across devices.
